        <div class="about_text">
            <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Elaisa, better known as Dona Moça or, simply, Flor. <strong>Comidas e Sabores da Flor</strong> is the result of a recipe with two main ingredients: the satisfaction I find in cooking and the pride of my Brazilian and Rio de Janeiro origins.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Cooking always aroused my curiosity and brought me enormous pleasure. After living in Brazil and Italy, in 2005 I came to Finland, and I had no doubts about the profession I was going to pursue. During the years of the vocational school, I kept combining the techniques I was learning with the experimentation of new recipes at home.</p>
            <div class="first_doub">
                <img class="about_pic" src="../Images/Foto2.jpg" alt="Flor happy in the kitchen">
                <p class="doub_text">I have always seen the kitchen space as a great laboratory, where each dish is second to none and an opportunity to express my identity. Around 2016, what had just started serving family and friends, became a greater purpose, the one of providing the Brazilian community in the Finnish capital with the flavors from the homeland.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Currently, <strong>Comidas e Sabores da Flor</strong> continues to develop with each order. My clients - which I affectionately call Flor'mores - are served with the same love and dedication I serve my own family. In addition to Brazilian meals, which are my trademark, I recently started venturing into confectionary, due to the clients’ requests.</p>
            <div class="second_doub">
                <img class="about_pic" src="../Images/Foto4.jpg" alt="Cakery from Brazil">
                <p class="doub_text">Confectionary is an aspect that I love and that I constantly educate myself about. In this area, it inspires me to know that I am the only granddaughter to follow in the footsteps of my late grandfather, who was a chef at Confeitaria Colombo, in Rio de Janeiro</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>For me, cooking is synonymous of affection and, therefore, I prefer to follow my intuition than to reproduce ready-made recipes. Something that gives me pleasure is to meet the challenges launched by friends and clients. For this reason, I also experiment with Italian, Thai, Indian and Finnish cuisine.</p>
            <div class="third_doub">
                <img class="about_pic" src="../Images/Foto3.jpg" alt="Flor working hard">
                <p class="doub_text">Today, I feel very fulfilled. I have regular Brazilian clients, as well as other nationalities, interested in the flavors of my country. I live with my husband, Italian, and my pre-teen son in Helsinki, and I would not trade that reality for anything in this world.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>I still have the dream of transforming <strong>Comidas e Sabores da Flor</strong> into my own establishment and serving customers not only with delicious food, but with a good chat, showered with laughter and conviviality.</p>
